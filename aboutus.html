      <h1>Our Story: Life Carved in Stone</h1>
      <p>Steinmetz Reuter is a journey that started in 1884, having roots in the passion for natural stone craftsmanship. For over 130 years, we have combined the artistry of an age with extraordinary skills in stone monuments to create legacies. Every order tells some story through the stoneâ€”from a memorial to customized art pieces or historical restoration. Behind every stone we carve is the business: our people, our values, and our dedication to heritage.</p>
      <h2>Legacy: Tradition Cast in Stone</h2>
      <p>In the beginning of Steinmetz Reuter, it was founded by Fritz Reuter, an artisan with passion, and a keen eye for making artistry an art. From a small workshop in Munich, that soon grew into one of the household names in all the stonemasonry world. Moving onward, the craft never slowed, and our workshop for so long has been a place where tradition never stopped fusing into innovation.</p>
      <p>Carving history, preserving memories, and making timeless art; that is what any stone tells. Here at our still living monument to the legacy of Fritz Reuter, generations of artisans have passed through its doors, and here, stones are shaped, not just for their beauty but also revered, for the stories they hold that came with them.</p>
